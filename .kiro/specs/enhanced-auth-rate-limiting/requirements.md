# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced Authentication & Rate Limiting System addresses critical issues in the current authentication flow, including invalid refresh token handling, excessive rate limiting triggering, and poor user experience during authentication failures. This system will provide robust session management, intelligent rate limiting, and comprehensive error handling to ensure secure and user-friendly authentication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication session to be properly managed with automatic token refresh, so that I don't get unexpectedly logged out due to token expiration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user's access token expires THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to refresh the token using the stored refresh token
2. WHEN a refresh token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL gracefully redirect the user to the login page with an appropriate message
3. WHEN token refresh is successful THEN the system SHALL update the stored tokens and continue the user's session seamlessly
4. IF a user has a valid session THEN the system SHALL not require re-authentication for protected routes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want intelligent rate limiting that doesn't penalize me for legitimate login attempts, so that I can access my account without unnecessary delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes login attempts THEN the system SHALL implement progressive rate limiting (increasing delays for repeated failures)
2. WHEN rate limiting is triggered THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about when the user can try again
3. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL reset their rate limit counter
4. IF a user is rate limited THEN the system SHALL still allow password reset requests
5. WHEN rate limiting occurs THEN the system SHALL distinguish between different failure reasons (wrong password vs. rate limit)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear and helpful error messages during authentication failures, so that I understand what went wrong and how to resolve it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages based on the failure type
2. WHEN a refresh token is not found THEN the system SHALL display "Session expired, please log in again" instead of technical errors
3. WHEN rate limiting is active THEN the system SHALL show the remaining wait time
4. IF login fails due to incorrect credentials THEN the system SHALL not reveal whether the email exists

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want comprehensive logging of authentication events, so that I can monitor security and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any authentication event occurs THEN the system SHALL log it with appropriate detail level
2. WHEN logging authentication attempts THEN the system SHALL include timestamp, IP address, user agent, and outcome
3. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL log additional security-relevant information
4. IF logging fails THEN the system SHALL not prevent the authentication process from continuing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust middleware system that handles authentication consistently across all protected routes, so that security is enforced uniformly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses a protected route THEN the middleware SHALL verify their authentication status
2. WHEN authentication verification fails THEN the middleware SHALL redirect appropriately based on the failure type
3. WHEN middleware processes requests THEN it SHALL handle both API routes and page routes consistently
4. IF middleware encounters errors THEN it SHALL fail securely by denying access
